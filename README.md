The project is going to be a website that includes a few of my favorite 
recipes. It will include recipies for beef jerky, home made pasta noodles, 
and a medium rate steak. The only way a steak should be cooked. 


In order to get to this point of the project I had to create a new 
repository on Github and then clone it onto my local machine. Then I 
opened the readme file and wrote this intro.# odin-recipes
